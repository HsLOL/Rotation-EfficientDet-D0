## A project for Rotaion Detector by Pytorch  
This is my first project to finish the rotation detection by PyTorch.  
## Update Log  
[2021-04-14] Start this project.  
[2021-04-14] Update the DOTA_toolkit, which is a general toolkit to help finishsome preprocess.  
[2021-04-16 - 2021-04-29] Finished this project roughly, I find the current detector has the unsastisfactory performance, and I will try my best to sovle these problems soon.  
[2021-04-29] Even the current rotation detector has a lower performace, I have already updated the relevant code.  
## The next step  
- [ ] Update the evaluation code for rotation detector.  
- [ ] Update the result of the whole DOTA picture.  
- [ ] Find and solve the problems that I find.  
## The performance about the current detector
